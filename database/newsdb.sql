Klein, 42, is facing an eight-count indictment, including multiple felony charges for assaulting and interfering with police at the Capitol and trying to obstruct Congress from certifying the results of the presidential election.But Bates found that other factors weighed in favor of releasing Klein as his case goes forward, including the lack of evidence that he planned for violence or took a leadership role; the fact that prosecutors hadn\'t objected to release for other Capitol riot defendants charged with assaulting police; and Klein\'s minimal past criminal history.\"Klein’s conduct was forceful, relentless, and defiant, but his confrontations with law enforcement were considerably less violent than many others that day, and the record does not establish that he intended to injure others,\" Bates wrote.Klein, who lives in Annandale, Virginia, has been in jail since his arrest on March 4 and will now be released to home detention. That means he can only leave his house for work, education, medical appointments, religious observances, court dates and meetings with his lawyer, and a small number of other preapproved reasons.Prosecutors have withdrawn detention requests in some cases in the weeks since the DC Circuit issued the opinion in the Munchel case, particularly for defendants who aren\'t charged with assaulting police or taking a leadership role in planning for violence on Jan. 6.Screenshot from police body camera footage that prosecutors say shows Federico Klein pushing police at the CapitolBut Bates wasn\'t convinced that Klein\'s past role in the Trump administration hurt his case for release now. Klein\'s alleged actions on Jan. 6 were \"troubling\" and represented a \"substantial and deeply concerning breach of trust,\" Bates wrote, but the judge wasn\'t clear how his previous job \"heightens\" his dangerousness going forward. Bates noted there was no suggestion by the government that Klein might try to abuse classified information he previously had access to and no evidence that he was affiliated with extremist groups.Bates cited other cases involving alleged Capitol rioters charged with hitting or deploying a Taser against police — and where there also wasn\'t evidence of advance planning — in which prosecutors didn\'t argue for detention. Those other cases didn\'t involve the same \"duration of force\" alleged in Klein\'s case, the judge wrote, but noted that Klein\'s \"most forceful conduct was directed to advancing and maintaining the mob’s position in the tunnel, not toward inflicting injury.\"In addition to home detention, Klein will be prohibited from going to the Capitol grounds, attending any political protests, contacting anyone else accused of participating in the Jan. 6 insurrection, and possessing any firearms or weapons.

The NRA may be effectively gone, but its messages still stand in the way.The National Rifle Association booth during the CPAC conference in February 2019 in MarylandWASHINGTON — Time after time, Democrats have tried to pass reforms to restrict access to firearms. Time after time, the National Rifle Association has led successful campaigns to block every bill.Now the NRA has imploded, and Democrats see an opening after a wave of mass shootings to start the year. Senate Republicans, though, see that as wishful thinking — in interviews this week, senators repeatedly said they don’t need an active NRA to tell them where they stand on guns. The NRA’s decades of work are already baked in.Democrats were already planning to try to extend background checks for firearm sales this year. The NRA being off the board is causing even more optimism that they can reach some bipartisan deal that can get through Congress.Democrats seem to be working toward a plan similar to the one that came a few votes shy of passing in 2013, though the details are fluid. That bill would have expanded background check requirements to guns sold online and at gun shows, while exempting most private sales between friends and family.Things have changed since that bill failed. The NRA was broadly popular at the time and even several Democrats sought its political endorsement. Four Democratic senators opposed the background checks bill. By 2018, after the school shooting in Parkland, the NRA’s polling was underwater — more people had an unfavorable view of the association than a favorable one — and Democrats were running midterm ads boasting about their F ratings on NRA report cards.“I think the gun lobby has lost its viselike grip on Congress,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal this week. “Now whether the political dynamic changes radically this session or if it takes another session to do it remains to be seen.”The NRA successfully killed the 2013 bill by arguing background checks were ineffective in stopping crime and an infringement on Second Amendment rights. Those views are by now dogma in most of the Republican Party. Most Republicans in Congress frame any gun control measures — even modest and broadly popular changes such as expanding existing background check laws to gun show sales — as undermining the Second Amendment.Despite the wave of recent mass shootings, Senate Republicans are showing no signs of budging from their opposition to new gun control laws. It’s not clear that there needs to be an NRA to deliver its message anymore. Republicans who talked to BuzzFeed News this week laughed off the idea that the collapse of the NRA will have any impact on a bill’s chances.“I think really people who run for office have made their decision on where they are on the Second Amendment, regardless of the different lobbying groups,” said Sen. Rand Paul.Sen. Ted Cruz said there’s no doubt the NRA’s financial troubles — which he described as political persecution by a Democratic attorney general — will limit its ability to champion its message. But he said that won’t matter because Republicans are already united.“I fully expect that Republicans will continue to defend the Second Amendment and I fully expect that virtually every Democrat will work tirelessly to undermine the Second Amendment,” said Cruz.With the Senate split 50–50, Democrats would need to win over 10 Republicans on any gun control measure to override a filibuster. Expanding background checks enjoys broad bipartisan support outside of Congress and polls show even a majority of Republicans are in favor. But this has been true for years, and no bill has come close to passing since 2013.Murphy, one of the Democratic point people in gun control talks, is not providing much information about his conversations with Republican lawmakers. His language has been guarded, saying this week it “isn’t out of the realm of possibility” that they can get enough votes to overcome a filibuster.While leaving the Senate on Wednesday, Republican Sen. Joni Ernst told BuzzFeed News that gun control is an issue where politicians already know where they stand and where their supporters stand. Asked if she would be open to the push to expand background checks, Ernst said she had not yet talked to Murphy, but would be happy to hear him out. Seconds later, she ran into him as he also headed to his office. “Good timing!” she said, beginning a conversation as they walked out of earshot.Paul McLeod is a politics reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in Washington, DC.

Alexander, 32; Samaria Blackwell, 19; Amarjeet Johal, 66; Jaswinder Kaur, 64; Jaswinder Singh, 68; Amarjit Sekhon, 48; Karli Smith, 19; and John Weisert, 74.On Friday, Indianapolis Deputy Police Chief Craig McCartt identified the shooter as Brandon Scott Hole, a 19-year-old who had contact with law enforcement in the past.McCartt said Hole was employed with FedEx until 2020, but it was unclear what motivated the deadly attack. A spokesperson for FedEx confirmed that Hole was a former employee at the facility but referred further questions to police.Of the five people transported to the hospital with injuries, McCartt said four had non-life-threatening gunshot wounds and the fifth had other unspecified injuries.A body is wheeled from the FedEx facility on April 16.“With less than 12 hours since the shooting, it would be premature to speculate on that motivation,\" said Paul Keenan, special agent in charge of the FBI\'s Indianapolis field office, which is assisting in the investigation.McCartt said Hole parked in the building\'s parking lot, got out of his car, and “pretty quickly started some random shooting outside the facility.\" He then went inside and continued the rampage, which lasted \"just a couple minutes.\"There were at least 100 people in the facility at the time, McCartt said, and many of them were either on a dinner break or a shift change.\"There was no confrontation with anyone that was there. There was no disturbance. There was no argument. He just appeared to randomly start shooting,\" he said.When officers reached Hole, McCartt said, they found him with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.The crime scene is still under investigation, and the people who were killed had not yet been formally identified, he added.A FedEx plane flies over the FexEx Ground facility where multiple people were shot and killed.Law enforcement had contact with Hole in the past, although McCartt said he did not have details on those encounters.

With no support from the mainstream medical community, conservative legislators have gone and found “this handful of people who have ‘MD’ after their name” but lack the research, experience, and evidence to back their claims, he said.A March 30 rally at the Alabama State House in Montgomery to draw attention to anti-transgender legislation introduced thereHeron Greenesmith, a senior analyst at Political Research Associates, a progressive think tank dedicated to studying the American right, told BuzzFeed News that the widely accepted studies into best practices for trans youth have been undermined by a few physicians and mental health providers who espouse right-wing or explicitly anti-LGBTQ views. “People tend not to question folks with a medical degree,” Greenesmith said.In statements to BuzzFeed News, both ACP and SEGM denied that they were promoting misinformation. Michelle Cretella, ACP’s executive director, called pediatric transition “an atrocity, not healthcare” and said that “society is being lied to and bullied by a medical establishment driven by a dangerous ideology and economic opportunity, not science and sound medical ethics.”SEGM member Roberto D’Angelo said the group was concerned with the “low quality of evidence” in gender-affirming treatment. “The key issue under consideration is how to weigh the low-certainty findings of improvements in mental health associated with medical interventions against the many known and many more as-yet-unknown long-term health risks,” he said.Medical providers and researchers still want more data to better understand various treatments, despite an established consensus. “We all agree that we need more data and that we wish there was more research,” said Olson, the Princeton researcher. But providers should still use the existing body of data to determine the best treatment for a trans child, she said: “I think it’s an unfair bar that we’ve created for trans healthcare.”But for now, all eyes are focused on the legislation being pushed in states across the country. And the fear in the trans community is very real.Casey Pick, a senior fellow for advocacy and government affairs at the Trevor Project, which operates a crisis intervention and suicide prevention helpline for LGBTQ youth, said their counselors have reported trans children and their families calling to ask what these bills are and when they’ll go into effect. Callers are distressed that the legislation will prevent them from getting the care they need, Pick said.“This should not be treated as a philosophical debate,” she said. “This is a real concrete concern to real, actual LGBT youth.” ●Aviva Stahl is a Brooklyn-based investigative journalist who writes about institutional failures to protect the most vulnerable.A BuzzFeed News investigation, in partnership with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, based on thousands of documents the government didn\'t want you to see.', '0');

The complaint alleges that the Stones used money from Drake Ventures to pay for personal expenses — “groceries, dentist bills, spas, salons, clothing and restaurant expenses,” according to the government — as well as make a down payment on a home, resolve some of their tax debt, and pay wages to relatives and other individuals without filing the required paperwork.“Although they used funds held in Drake Ventures accounts to pay some of their taxes, the Stones’ use of Drake Ventures to hold their funds allowed them to shield their personal income from enforced collection and fund a lavish lifestyle despite owing nearly $2 million in unpaid taxes, interest and penalties,” prosecutors wrote.Prosecutors alleged the condo purchase was “marked by numerous badges of fraud,” noting that the Stones owed so much money to the US government at that point that they were “insolvent.”In March 2019, the Stones failed to make their monthly $19,485 payment to the IRS. That dissolved the installment agreement and opened them up to potential legal action.“We lost our home, our savings, my car and most of our insurance in my epic fight for freedom list year.

He\'s Also Been Accused Of Stalking His Ex.', 'Stephanie McNeal', '63', '2021-04-16 00:00:00', '3', 'Speaking to Robin Roberts, Underwood explained it had taken him years to come to terms with the fact he is gay, even going so far as to appear on one of the most heteronormative shows on television while struggling with his sexuality.\"I\'ve ran from myself for a long time. I\'ve hated myself for a long time,\" Underwood said.Underwood’s years of turmoil and struggle were clear on his face during the interview, in which he was visibly emotional and nervous. He explains his childhood growing up as part of the Catholic Church made him feel being gay was a sin, and that anti-gay slurs he heard during his sports career (he played football at Illinois State University and briefly in the NFL) only added to the shame he felt. He discussed deeply personal issues, alluding to suicidal thoughts and self-hatred.According to Randolph, Underwood also began stalking her apartment and her parents’ home in Huntington Beach, California, after they split, harassing her about male friends visiting her, and sending her text messages like, “I am going to keep you accountable.” The incidents culminated in Underwood allegedly sending Randolph threatening messages from an anonymous number and then saying he had also been under attack. Court records state that Randolph then found the tracker on her car and filed the temporary restraining order and police report. The court granted the temporary restraining order but didn’t rule on the allegations.“Colton was absolutely in love with Cassie. It was clear she did not feel the same way about him, which of course, upset him. It was really hard for him,” the source told Us Weekly. “She literally broke up with him as soon as he was healthy enough to move out [from COVID-19].” The source also told the magazine that Randolph had been “very nervous about losing her fanbase” after the split and that Randolph had been seeing her ex “shortly after” the breakup with Underwood. Randolph did not respond to the Us Weekly report.After news of the restraining order and the tabloid defenses of Underwood broke, her Instagram comments were flooded with hate. People accused Randolph of “playing” Underwood, being “manipulative,” and “ruining Colton’s life.”\"Today Cassie asked the court to dismiss the temporary restraining order against me. The two of us were able to reach a private agreement to address any of Cassie’s concerns,\" he told the magazine. \"I do not believe Cassie did anything wrong in filing for the restraining orders and also believe she acted in good faith. I appreciate everyone’s respect for privacy regarding this matter.\"Meanwhile, Randolph stayed mostly silent, and a source told Us Weekly that she just wanted the public back-and-forth to end.“Cassie just wants to move forward in life with stuff she has going on like settling into her new place. She definitely doesn’t want to bring up her past again,” the insider told Us Weekly. “It’s exhausting for her to deal with his ‘version’ of things, so she’s chosen to not make any remarks or give into it anymore.”Given everything that has happened, it is unfathomable that, amid all the coverage of Underwood’s coming out, no one is asking Underwood to fully account for the allegations against him and reflect on how Randolph has been vilified online by his defenders.\"I would like to say sorry for how things ended. I messed up,\" he said. \"I made a lot of bad choices.\"But his apology feels rather hollow. After all, there is a big difference between making a “bad choice” and allegedly harassing and stalking someone. While Roberts, and those participating in the glowing news coverage of Underwood’s interview, were unwilling to ask Underwood to confront the allegations head-on, there is one group that hasn’t forgotten: the fans. Several went on social media to point out that Underwood has never truly owned up to his alleged actions, or really, taken accountability for perpetuating a narrative that led to online harassment of Randolph by his supporters.Colton coming out doesn’t erase the fact that he stalked and terrorized his previous girlfriend #TheBachelorCongrats to Colton Underwood for living his truth, but it’s weird and tacky that @GMA would give him this airtime after he harassed, stalked, and made his ex fear for her life. I’m supposed to have a change of heart now? Nah, stalkers can go fuck themselves.Many criticized the opportunities being heaped on him, saying it seemed clear that Underwood was attempting to rehab his image.But for him to do so without acknowledging the real hurt and pain he caused, for both Randolph and the fans, feels wrong. It’s fine to continue to stay in the public eye and share your truth after making big mistakes, but this feels more like sweeping serious allegations under the rug than an atonement.Stephanie McNeal is a social news editor for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.A BuzzFeed News investigation, in partnership with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, based on thousands of documents the government didn\'t want you to see.', '0');

INSERT INTO `news` VALUES ('OG Mom Blogger Taza Missed A Huge Opportunity To Get Real In Her New Book', 'Stephanie McNeal', '67', '2021-04-16 00:00:00', '4', 'In this week\'s newsletter: The influencer\'s highly anticipated first book was sadly disappointing, and a case for Chris Crocker selling the iconic \"Leave Britney Alone\" video as an NFT.Unfortunately, the book is only surface-level, with so little insight into Naomi’s actual life that I am struggling to understand why she wrote it in the first place.Many followers, myself included, wondered if Naomi would use the book, published about a year later, to offer insight and reflection on this incident. Besides that though, I also had hoped to get insight into Naomi’s life as an OG blogger. Influencer memoirs are rare, and few have revealed in detail what it is actually like to make your family into a brand that can support all of you financially. I was excited to see what Naomi would share, in a memoir that promised to contain “all-new intimate and vulnerable essays” about her personal life.I am pretty disappointed in what the book actually contains. Rather than get real and vulnerable with her readers, Naomi glosses over her life and feelings to such an extent that it genuinely leaves me confused as to who this book is for. The chapters are extremely short, barely a dozen pages long each, and the content is similarly sparse. The most maddening part is that Naomi actually does have good ideas for each chapter, and she explores some interesting topics. However, once she introduces them, she essentially cuts herself off from finishing the thought, abruptly ending each chapter with some version of “You can do it, mama!” or “Then I learned to believe in myself!” or another platitude.Take one chapter, entitled “She’s Getting Married.” In it, Naomi describes the judgment and reactions she faced from her peers and teachers at Juilliard when, at age 20 and in the middle of studies for her dance degree, she decided to get married. She explains how judged she felt (she was apparently told multiple times she was the only woman to ever get married in the middle of the prestigious dance program) by professors who thought she was throwing all her hard work and talent away. I would have loved to hear more about how Naomi felt preparing for studying at Juilliard her whole life, only to realize maybe that it wasn’t fulfilling all along (she alludes to feeling “burnout” from dance, but doesn’t elaborate).In the end, Naomi says, she solved this problem by just deciding she doesn\'t care what people think. In fact, she writes, that’s what her husband, Josh, says when she worries about how people judge her choices: “Who cares?” So she decided not to care, she writes, ending the chapter. She applies this philosophy to several more issues in her life, writing essentially the same conclusion to other challenges she has faced like feeling judged for doing IVF in her early twenties, breastfeeding in public, and getting mean comments online. Come on, Naomi, that’s it? I’m sure it took more than just changing your mindset to get past these existential issues in your life.Another disappointing aspect of the book is how little insight there is into Naomi’s blog and career. Josh quit his job in finance to help her run the blog — she discusses this but never shares what doing it was actually like. How fascinating would it be to get a real accounting of launching an influencer career with your husband in the mid-2010s? Instead, Naomi shares one paragraph about their journey, saying they have argued and they have sometimes “failed.” But ultimately, it was worth it. What? At this point, I’m annoyed. Why tease us with these interesting topics if you won’t explore them?What a shame!—Stephanie McNealI resent anytime I have to learn about another make-believe cryptocurrency, but for the sake of viral internet history, I tried my best this week.So the news that the “Leave Britney Alone” video is valued at $41K today feels right and restorative.

Nelson is expected to call his own medical experts to testify.Baker said Floyd\'s enlarged heart already needed more oxygen than normally required due to his \"severe underlying heart disease\" and a history of hypertension.Floyd\'s interaction with the officers would have caused him to release stress hormones like adrenaline, Baker said, which would cause his heart to beat faster and require more oxygen.According to Baker, Floyd\'s encounter with Chauvin and three other officers \"tipped him over the edge\" given his heart\'s condition.\"We watch those videos, he’s breathing, he\'s talking, he\'s not snoring, he\'s saying, \'Please get off me, I can\'t breathe.\' That is not a fentanyl overdose, that is someone begging to breathe,\" Smock said.The medical experts also said asphyxia is not typically listed on autopsies because, as Tobin said, \"it doesn\'t leave a fingerprint.\"Tasneem Nashrulla is a reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York. \nA BuzzFeed News investigation, in partnership with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, based on thousands of documents the government didn\'t want you to see.', '1');

The defense argues that Floyd\'s use of illicit drugs and underlying medical conditions were the key factors.The jury was shown an image from an officer\'s body camera video in which Floyd\'s knuckles are seen pressed against the tire of the squad car while Chauvin\'s knees are on his neck and back.\"This tells you that [Floyd] has used up his resources, and he\'s now literally trying to breathe with his fingers and knuckles,\" Tobin said.\"When those are wasted up, then you\'re relying on these types of muscles like your fingers to try and stabilize your whole right side,\" Tobin said, \"because [Floyd\'s] totally dependent on getting air into the right side.\"Tobin said that Floyd\'s left side was squeezed in a \"vise\" between the officers on top of him pushing his handcuffs against his back and the \"hard asphalt\" of the street.\"He was being squashed between the two sides,\" Tobin said, adding that his ability to expand his left side to breathe was \"enormously impaired.\"He testified that Floyd was \"using his fingers and his knuckles against the street to try and crank up the right side of his chest\" as it was \"his only way to try and get air to get into the right lung.\"Floyd also tried to use his shoulder to breathe on his left side, which is \"one of the very last muscles\" people use to breathe, Tobin said.Tobin said that video showed Floyd contracting his shoulder to try to get oxygen but that it was \"ineffective.\"\"It\'s a very poor way of breathing,\" Tobin told the jury, \"but it\'s what you have to do when everything else is failing.\"The jury was also shown an image where Chauvin\'s toe was seen lifted off the ground while his knee was on Floyd\'s neck.

Richard Zimmerman, and Chauvin’s now-retired former supervisor, Sgt. David Pleoger, testified against him during his murder trial in the killing of Floyd.Arradondo, who joined the department in 1989 and steadily rose through the ranks to become the city’s first Black police chief three years ago, gave damaging testimony against the former officer on Monday, saying he “vehemently disagreed” with Chauvin’s use of force against Floyd during his arrest on May 25, 2020.“There’s an initial reasonableness in trying to get him under control in the first few seconds,” Arradondo told the jury. “But once there was no longer any resistance — and clearly when Mr. Floyd was no longer responsive and even motionless — to continue to apply that level of force to a person prone down, handcuffed behind their back … that in no way, shape, or form is part of our policy, is not part of our training, and is not part of our ethics and values.”Chauvin’s defense strategy is that Floyd’s use of drugs and underlying medical conditions contributed to his death and that the officer\'s actions were consistent with police training and policies.However, Arradando told the court that Chauvin’s action of pressing his knee on Floyd’s neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds “absolutely” violated the department\'s use-of-force policy and went against its “ethics and values.”“That is not part of our policy,” Arradando told the jury when shown the now-viral image of Chauvin looking up while putting Floyd in a knee chokehold. “That is not what we teach.”An image of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd\'s neck shown to Arradando on MondayArradando said that Chauvin’s actions did not constitute “objectively reasonable force” and that the neck restraint he used on Floyd was not taught to officers as part of their training.“When I look at this image and when I look at the facial expression of Mr. Floyd, that does not appear in any way, shape, or form that is light to moderate pressure,” Arradondo testified in court.Another high-ranking police official, Inspector Katie Blackwell, who until recently was the commander of the department\'s training division, also testified that Chauvin’s neck restraint was not consistent with police training.“I don’t know what kind of improvised position this is,” she said referring to Chauvin putting his knee on Floyd’s neck. “This is not what we train.”The police chief said Chauvin should have stopped restraining Floyd as soon as he had stopped resisting and “certainly once when he was in distress and trying to verbalize.”Videos showed Floyd crying out multiple times that he could not breathe and that he was going to die. Several bystanders testified last week about seeing Floyd become unconscious and “limp” as Chauvin continued to dig his knee into his neck.According to Arradondo, Chauvin also violated department policies by not rendering medical aid to Floyd when officers could not find a pulse as well by failing to deescalate the situation.“That action is not deescalation,” Arradondo said. “When we talk about our framework of the sanctity of life and the principles and values of life, that action goes contrary to what we’re talking about.”His statements echoed what two other department officials testified as witnesses for the prosecution last week.“That would be considered top-tier deadly force because of the fact that if you kneel on a person’s neck that can kill him,” Zimmerman told the jury.Lt. Richard Zimmerman testifies during Derek Chauvin\'s murder trial.Zimmerman, who responded to the scene hours after Floyd had been transported to the hospital, said Chauvin’s action of using his knee to crush his neck for so long went too far.\"First of all, pulling [Floyd] down to the ground facedown and putting your knee on the neck for that amount of time is just uncalled for,” Zimmerman said. “I saw no reason why the officers felt they were in danger, if that’s what they felt, and that’s what they would have to feel to be able to use that kind of force.”Like Arradondo, Zimmerman testified that Chauvin should have ended his restraint of Floyd once he was handcuffed and lying prone on the ground.Chauvin’s former supervisor, Pleoger, also testified last week that officers should have “ended the restraint” when Floyd was “no longer offering any resistance to the officers.\"Citing department training, both Arradondo and Zimmerman said that officers should move subjects who are handcuffed in the prone position to their side or have them sit up “as soon as possible” to avoid the danger of constricting their breathing or what is known as “positional asphyxia.”Both the veteran cops said that department officers are obligated to provide medical assistance to a distressed subject in custody even after they have called an ambulance and even while they are using defensive tactics against the subject.“They’re still in our custody, and they have rights and the humanity of this profession. We need to make sure we’re protecting them,” Arradondo said.An emergency care doctor who pronounced Floyd dead at the hospital testified Monday that for every minute a patient in cardiac arrest does not receive CPR, their chance of survival decreases by 10% to 15%. He said Floyd had been in cardiac arrest for at least 30 minutes before he arrived at the hospital.In his cross-examination of the Minneapolis Police Department officials, Chauvin’s attorney, Eric Nelson, asked them about whether an increasingly “hostile” crowd of bystanders that was growing bigger and angrier at the officers’ actions would affect their decisions on the use of force and deescalation.This image from a police body camera shows bystanders, whom Chauvin\'s attorney has characterized as a \"hostile\" and \"angry\" crowd.Arradondo said that, per department policy, bystanders were allowed to express their First Amendment rights and record officers’ actions but not “physically” obstruct them. He agreed that one way to deescalate a crow experiencing something shocking would be for the officers to stop doing the thing that’s shocking to them.“Of all the things we do as police officers for the Minneapolis Police Department, the thousands of calls we respond to, it is my firm belief that one single incident we will forever be judged on will be our use of force,” Arradando said. “While it is absolutely imperative that our officers go home at the end of their shift, we want to make sure our community members do too.”Tasneem Nashrulla is a reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York. \nA BuzzFeed News investigation, in partnership with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, based on thousands of documents the government didn\'t want you to see.', '0');

INSERT INTO `news` VALUES ('Here\'s Why You Can\'t Compare The Extremely Rare J&J Vaccine Blood Clots To Ones Linked To Birth Control', 'Lauren Strapagiel', '78', '2021-04-14 00:00:00', '6', 'The causes and treatments are not the same, doctors told BuzzFeed News. Still, the Johnson & Johnson pause is no reason to panic.But while the Pill is known to increase risk for blood clots, three doctors who spoke with BuzzFeed News said these are two very different scenarios.\"It’s not only not apples to apples, it’s basically apples to papayas. It is completely different,\" said Hanny al-Samkari, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a hematologist and clinical investigator at Massachusetts General Hospital. \"Yes, they both can cause clots — just like apples and papayas are both fruits — but the mechanisms are totally different.\"On Tuesday, the pause on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was recommended after six women between the ages of 18 and 48 developed a rare type of blood clot within 13 days of receiving the vaccine. One woman died and another is in critical care, according to the FDA. But approximately 6.85 million doses of the vaccine had been delivered in the US as of April 13, meaning the complication appears to affect fewer than 1 in a million recipients.These extremely rare blood clots are of a severe kind that appear to significantly raise the risk of a stroke. Al-Samkari noted that the key characteristic of these clots is a drop in blood platelet counts. Crucially, unlike other blood clots, the blood-thinning medication heparin is a dangerous treatment for patients with these clots.But, crucially, it\'s not the same clotting as that experienced by some with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\"They could not be more different when we talk about the underlying mechanism,\" said al-Samkari.The typical blood clot linked to birth control is called deep vein thrombosis, a clot that develops in the leg but can break off and travel to the lungs. Those are usually treated with blood thinners.Jeff Weitz, a thrombosis expert and professor at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, said another difference between the types of clotting was that someone with an underlying hereditary condition who takes the Pill can be more at risk for clotting.Based on those six cases, the risk of a blood clot issue from the vaccine remains much lower than that from taking hormonal birth control.That has some people wondering why there\'s been so much concern over the Johnson & Johnson vaccine when so many millions of people take hormonal birth control every day. The reason is that vaccines, especially for shots newly authorized on an emergency basis, have a higher safety requirement than other medicines that have long been in use.\"This is part of the robust monitoring system that we have in the United States,” said Jennifer Lighter, an infectious diseases specialist and hospital epidemiologist at NYU Langone Health. “This is a good thing that we take serious adverse effects very seriously, and we pause and investigate. That’s what you want in a country that rolls out a new vaccine or medication.\"Lighter pointed out that the risk of dying from COVID-19 — more than 563,000 deaths in the US have been attributed to the disease — remains much higher than any risk of fatal complications after receiving a vaccine of any type.Al-Samkari said anyone who has received the Johnson & Johnson or AstraZeneca vaccine, particularly young women, should talk to a doctor if they \"start developing any significant, severe untoward symptom.\" He said symptoms like severe headache, sharp leg pains, or changes to the senses or nervous system that come on suddenly should be checked out.\"If it’s unusual and it’s out of the blue and it’s severe and it doesn’t go away, that’s when you want to see your doctor and get it evaluated immediately,\" he said. (People who had the shot a month ago are in the clear, federal health officials noted, because symptoms would have developed by now. The concern is chiefly among people who got the shot within the last few weeks.)Al-Samkari added that the precautions taken by regulators shouldn\'t scare people or make them hesitant to get vaccinated — quite the opposite.\"The main message I tell people after seeing this is this should make everyone feel very comfortable,\" he said. \"If something was happening potentially related to a vaccination and our regulators were ignoring it or waving it off, that would be the danger place, that would be food for the anti-vaxxers.

INSERT INTO `news` VALUES ('J&J’s Vaccine Is Still On Pause After A CDC Safety Panel Put Off A Vote', 'Dan Vergano', '79', '2021-04-16 00:00:00', '6', 'At least six women, including one who died, have developed an extremely rare blood-clotting syndrome after getting the vaccine.\n    Posted on April 14, 2021, at 6:49 p.m. ET\n    An independent CDC expert panel on Wednesday put off a vote on whether the pause of Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine should continue, citing a need for data expected to come in the next two weeks on the shot’s links to an extremely rare and dangerous blood-clotting illness.“We are not ready to vote at this time,” said panel chair José Romero of the Arkansas Department of Health. Another meeting of the group will be scheduled by Friday.Their indecision reflects the thorny public health dilemma before regulators in the US as well as the rest of the world.A similar clotting syndrome has been reported among more than 100 recipients of the AstraZeneca vaccine in Europe, which uses a technology similar to J&J’s. The condition is thought to perhaps result from the vaccine triggering an allergic reaction against a protein in blood platelets under very rare circumstances, leading to blood clots that might cause strokes or other problems.In the US, the reports of alarming side effects from the J&J vaccine — which has been given to about 7 million people since late February — lead to tough questions: whether it is in the public’s overall best interest to continue to administer the shot, restrict it to some people, or cancel it altogether.On Wednesday, many ACIP panel members said they thought the best way to instill public trust would be to collect more data about the cases and underlying science before making a call. “By having a little more robust information, I think we can be much more confident in how we talk about the safety of this vaccine,” said Lynn Bahta of the Minnesota Department of Health. “Right now the confidence for COVID vaccines is just right at a precipice. We’ve got people that can’t wait to get it, and others who have been waiting and seeing. This contributes to that confidence that people have.”“Putting this vaccine on pause for those of us who are frontline workers has been devastating,” said Camille Kotton, an infectious disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital. “I agree in general that we don’t have enough data to make a decision at this time, but we were planning on using this vaccine in the state of Massachusetts for people who are homebound and otherwise not able to get a vaccine.” Suspending use of the vaccine for any period of time is a “significant loss” for those underserved populations, she said.FDA official Doran Fink suggested that the vaccine could continue to be distributed as long as doctors and recipients were better informed about the signs and risks of the clotting syndrome, so anyone experiencing the side effect could get the correct treatment right away. The option was discussed by the panel, but the experts felt uncomfortable embracing it for now.At a White House briefing earlier on Wednesday, federal officials said that enough doses of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are available to vaccinate the US population, even without the J&J shots. More than 192 million of those doses have been administered in the US in total and are continuing at a rate of 3.3 million a day. There are roughly 13 million doses of the J&J vaccine waiting for administration either at clinics or in delivery, according to the CDC.Representatives from Janssen, the pharmaceutical arm of J&J, relayed on Wednesday that the federal vaccine safety system had reported a likely seventh case in a 28-year-old woman, with details still being collected. Information on her platelet levels was not available at the time.Heparin was given to four of the six women in question, three of whom had not recovered as of mid-April, Janssen said on Wednesday. It was not clear whether heparin caused the one death, CDC officials said.Both the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines rely on a harmless virus to deliver the coronavirus spike protein to immunize people, as do Russia\'s Sputnik vaccine and China’s CanSino Biologics vaccine. This \"adenovirus\" class of vaccines is particularly useful in immunization efforts because it only requires standard refrigeration and, in J&J’s case, just one shot. There is now concern that this class may uniformly carry a risk of clotting side effects, however “extremely rare” they may be, as federal officials emphasized this week. No cases have been seen in earlier Ebola or respiratory syncytial virus vaccines that use the technology, according to Janssen.The technology is different from the one underpinning the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, both of which use mRNA to teach the body how to make a protein that triggers an immune response to the coronavirus. No cases of CVST with low blood platelets have been reported among people who have received Moderna or Pfizer vaccines.At Wednesday’s meeting, Janssen representatives argued in favor of continuing to administer the vaccine to the population at large while telling doctors about the symptoms and treatment of the clotting syndrome. “Based on the current data, Janssen believes the overall benefit-risk profile for our vaccine is positive across the population for which it’s authorized,” Aran Maree, Janssen’s chief medical officer, told the ACIP.But CDC official Sara Oliver put forth the case for extending the pause for a limited period of time or restricting the vaccine on the basis of gender or age, such as to only men or only people above age 50. She pointed out that the number of these blood clots reported so far, while still very rare, exceeds the number that would be expected to normally occur among young women. Oliver also noted that the country’s supply of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines is expected to remain steady for the foreseeable future.“The decision isn\'t necessarily receipt of a Janssen vaccine versus remaining at risk for COVID,” she said. “The decision may be receipt of a Janssen vaccine versus receipt of another mRNA vaccine.”This post has been updated to include the daily number of deaths from COVID-19 in the US.Dan Vergano is a science reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in Washington, DC.Stephanie M.

As more people in the city were attacked, she ordered pepper spray and watched videos on how to use it in an emergency. But she wanted a backup.So this year, she got a kubotan for situations where she might need to engage physically. She keeps the kubotan and alarm on her keychain in one coat pocket, and the pepper spray in the other. She has also studied jujitsu. “It’s just multiple ways of defending yourself,” she said.Kim said while efforts by the NYPD, like the formation of the Asian Hate Crimes Task Force, have helped her “feel safer to a certain extent,” she wanted to be able to protect herself when police are not around. “Most times, police aren’t present during an attack.”\"I definitely have that concern where I might just panic and freeze up or not remember that I have those devices,” she said. “Or something can happen so fast or they come up from behind you and you have no time to react. But I guess I feel like it’s better than having nothing at all on my body.\"A mini stun gunJeanie Pai, who’s in her thirties and a native New Yorker, acquired pepper spray and a sharp cat-ear knuckle keychain over the past year. She said she bought these two items in bulk and handed them out to her closest friends and family.“I can’t say I feel safer, but the items do bring about a heightened sense of awareness and vigilance,” said Pai.“The dichotomy of today’s bystander effect in urban areas is unbelievable, and it’s heartbreaking how I can’t trust witnesses to help if I’m ever attacked,” Pai said. “Carrying my defense weapon gives me peace of mind, but it is also a sad reminder of my vulnerability as an Asian woman.”These tools, she believes, are “not only for yourself but to protect others if you see someone in trouble.”A keychain alarm and kubotanTwitter user @kehlar, a 46-year-old Taiwanese American woman who wished to remain anonymous, felt the need to up the ante of self-defense in a major way this year: She started carrying around a whistle and alarm anytime she stepped outside her Bay Area home. She tweeted in March that she felt \"like an easy target\" because she\'s \"a petite middle-aged Asian woman.\"“I’m at a point now that I feel that we as AAPIs need to take matters into our own hands and protect ourselves and the vulnerable people in our community,” she said.“Carrying these self-defense items makes me feel more ready to defend myself. I’m not sure that it makes me feel safer.”RJ Castaneda, a Filipinx American resident of the Bay Area, recently bought pepper spray for his parents, sister, and female cousin. He now carries pepper spray as well when he goes out for exercise and has attended a bystander intervention workshop. “I fear randomly being attacked while running,” he said, adding that he is even more worried for his sister and cousin. “Being a woman already has its safety concerns, but the surge in Asian attacks only added on.”Almost everyone BuzzFeed News spoke to acknowledged the pragmatism of self-defense tools as a short-term coping mechanism. These items offer protection not just from assailants but from the fear Asian Americans shoulder as they simply move through an average day.“There are so many people who are scared and not leaving their homes,” said Barbara Yau, cofounder of the groups Concerned Asian American Citizens of New York City and Safe From Hate, which has distributed thousands of free personal safety alarms. “I think that people are just looking for confidence when they walk out the door. They want to have some kind of plan.”Yau, like many others, does not believe a few self-defense tools can fully address problems hundreds of years in the making.“I don’t think [these devices are] really a solution, unfortunately,” said Yau. “We were hoping that news would get out and people would be afraid to attack if people had some kind of alarm. But I think it is a Band-Aid. I don’t see that it’s deterring crime at all.”A keychain alarm, pepper spray, a kubotan, and a stun gunThe US has a long history of anti-Asian racism and violence dating back to the 1870s, when Chinese workers who made low wages were blamed for rising unemployment rates and lynched in cities across the West. By 1925, immigrants from most of Asia were barred from entering the country.But those fixes seem far more distant than the measures available today.Choi, the 41-year-old from Brooklyn, said that immediately following the mass killings at the Atlanta spas, she organized a group of her friends, mostly Asian women, for self-defense training with a martial artist in her backyard. The class, however practical and imperative for self-protection, was also about communal processing.“That experience was so much about being able to gather with other Asian women, connect in real time and in person over the tragedy and the violence, laugh and be worried and practice poking an eye out,” she said. “It was about being together and remembering we have each other, too.”“Does a self-defense class in a Brooklyn backyard dismantle systemic violence? Does it end anti-Asian racism and misogyny? Does it change gun laws in America? No and no and no. And all of that is big, big, big. But you know what would make me feel safer?

Baer', '84', '2021-04-15 00:00:00', '1', 'Chicago\'s Civilian Office of Police Accountability released videos showing the fatal shooting of 13-year-old Adam Toledo.\n    Posted on April 15, 2021, at 3:52 p.m. ET\n    Two boys hold signs demanding justice for Adam Toledo during a press conference last week.A 13-year-old boy who was shot and killed in Chicago by a police officer had his hands up when the cop fired his weapon, new videos show.The city\'s Civilian Office of Police Accountability posted the videos online Thursday along with other recordings and police reports related to the shooting of Adam Toledo, following weeks of protest over the boy\'s killing and demands to release the body camera footage to the public.What the videos showed amounted to an \"assassination,\" Adeena Weiss-Ortiz, the Toledo family\'s attorney, said at a press conference Thursday evening.\"If you\'re shooting an unarmed child with his hands in the air, it is an assassination,\" she told reporters.Still images from police body-worn camera show Adam Toledo with his hands in the air.Footage from the body camera worn by the officer who fatally shot Toledo shows the cop running after him, yelling, “Stop. Stop right fucking now.”“Hands. Show me your fucking hands. Drop it,” the officer yells, according to the video.Two seconds after being ordered to raise his hands, the boy can be seen with his hands up as the officer fires one round, causing Toledo to fall backward to the ground at an opening along a fence. A gun is not visible in the body-worn video at the time of the shooting, which took place 20 seconds after the officer stepped out of his police car.After shooting, the officer runs toward the boy and radios for an ambulance. The video then shows officers attempting first aid over several minutes as Toledo lies gravely wounded. Three and a half minutes after the shooting, officers discover a handgun behind the fence, several feet from where Toledo was being treated.He was pronounced dead at the scene.A cropped still image from an officer\'s body-worn camera shows the discovery of a handgun several feet from where Toledo was shot.Footage from a camera across a parking lot next to the alley shows Toledo\'s right arm moving behind the fence, making a tossing motion, before he turns back toward the officer with his hands up.The attorney added it was irrelevant whether Toledo had been carrying a gun.\"It could be a gun. I\'m not going to deny that it could be a gun,\" she said. \"It is not relevant because he tossed the gun. If he had a gun, he tossed it. The officer said, \'Show me your hands.\' He complied. He turned around.\"Weiss-Ortiz added, \"Whatever he had in his hand, there was something in his hand. He approaches the fence, lets it go, he turns around, and is shot.\"In a statement to BuzzFeed News, Tim Grace, an attorney for Stillman, said that in his viewing, Toledo had the gun when he was confronted.Grace said officers had responded to shots fired at a passing car in the area and that the shell casings matched the gun recovered near Toledo.In the statement, Grace said Toledo\'s movement of turning around and raising his hands — which occurred after Stillman yelled at him to show his hands — could be interpreted as \"attempting to acquire a target\" as he turned to face the officer.“At this point the officer was faced with a deadly force situation and all attempts to deescalate had failed,” Grace said, adding that nonlethal force was not a safe or effective option. “The officer had no place to take cover or concealment, the gun was being [orientated] in his direction and he was left with no other option.”According to Weiss-Ortiz, the officer did not appear to have any previous discipline or \"incidents.\"Toledo\'s death has sparked outrage across the city, where young people in many communities are often exposed to gun violence. The seventh-grader is the youngest person in years to be killed by Chicago police, according to the Tribune.Ahead of the release, Mayor Lori Lightfoot described viewing the footage as \"excruciating.\" She also urged Chicagoans to respond peacefully and cautioned that the videos should not be viewed by children.\"Even as our understanding of this incident continues to evolve, this remains a complicated and nuanced story, and we all must proceed with deep empathy and calm,\" she said during a press conference Thursday.The mayor said Thursday that the city had failed Toledo as she called on the community to use his death as an opportunity to \"do better for our young people ... so that they can walk a life in their streets, in their neighborhoods, without fear, without feeling like they are prey wherever the violence comes from.\"Stephanie Baer is a reporter with BuzzFeed News and is based in Los Angeles.

A year later, Philando Castile. In 2020, George Floyd. And on Sunday, Daunte Wright. Over and over again, Minneapolis residents have had to relive the trauma of watching a police officer kill a Black man — and they\'re exhausted.At a memorial event at the site of Wright’s death on Tuesday, one woman said she felt like she was experiencing déjà vu.“It’s almost May, and we’re doing exactly what we were doing last May,” she said, referring to Floyd’s death in May 2020.“My trust is not in this system no more; my trust is in you,” one man said at Wright’s memorial event. “I’ll be damned if we go another 400 years letting history repeat itself.”Volunteers, staffers, and faculty members sort through donations at Brooklyn Center High School in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, on April 14.The heart of the Minneapolis area is one with multiple nodes, from the George Floyd memorial site to community center parking lots and high schools, where dozens of people are distributing food to those in need. It also includes the people who are organizing for change and trying to heal.Leslie Redmond, president of the NAACP’s Minneapolis branch, has been trying to help the community through a healing-focused approach. In February, she formed the Community Healing Team, which brings together locals — including a therapist, professor, comedian, rapper, and religious leaders.The group came together just before the trial began for Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who killed Floyd by pressing a knee into his neck for more than 9 minutes. Redmond said the goal was initially to help people process the trial, but the scope of the project changed after Wright\'s death.“Now we\'re having to help them survive another murder,” Redmond told BuzzFeed News. “And so we continue to throw salt on open wounds, but our work doesn\'t stop.”On Tuesday afternoon, the Community Healing Team came to Wright’s memorial site and led a crowd through prayers and breathing exercises. A microphone was passed around to those who wanted to say a few words.Redmond said it’s important to incorporate healing into activism, especially when planning for the long term. She said there are “deep wounds” in the community, which is still recovering from the police killings of Clark, Castile, and Floyd.“We have to meet people where they are. We have to love people based on who they are, not who we want them to be,” Redmond said. “That means loving everyone and loving them as they are and loving them as they come. And so, for me, representation is important.”People in and around the city have their own ways of channeling their grief. On Wednesday afternoon, a 27-year-old Minneapolis resident named José came to Wright’s memorial site and burned a bundle of sage.“I lit it around his little memorial and over where his spirit lay so he can feel like it’s OK to leave, because I know he’s trapped here and he’s scared,” he said. “So I feel like that sage would be good just to tell him that it’s OK to go. It’s fine. We’ll take care of you here.”Brooklyn Center High School students work on posters on April 14.Meanwhile, other community efforts are unfolding in Minneapolis.Josh Fraser, principal of Brooklyn Center Community Schools, has spent the past several days working with dozens of school staffers, students, activists, and community members to gather food, toiletries, and household supplies for people in need to distribute at a community recreation center.“I got little left in the tank,” he said Wednesday morning. “Mentally, I\'m not at my best, but I\'m just trying to move around physically because that\'s what I can give right now.”Shortly after Wright’s death, Fraser said, activists from Minneapolis gave advice on how to get in touch with businesses and groups that could provide food, refrigerators, tables, chairs, and anything else they might need to distribute supplies to people in need. He said that, unfortunately, the back-to-back tragedies of Floyd’s and Wright’s deaths have forged these connections between school leaders and activists.“There [were] so many lessons to learn about how to interconnect people and connect the dots,” he said. “And they’ve just really helped us with that because that\'s not something we\'ve done before [on] this large of a scale. This murder, this tragedy, has taught us how to be an even better community school. Unfortunately, this was something that did that for us.”Inside the high school, about a dozen students were gathered in the cafeteria painting protest signs. Some were meant for the streets, but most were for school grounds on Thursday, when students will come to protest in a safe environment.The events were planned by the school’s Youth Participatory Action Research club, which is focused on volunteer work and social justice issues. One of the members, 17-year-old Nayeli Williams, told BuzzFeed News that it’s been heartening to see support from the teachers and donations from the community.“When people are volunteering their time to make signs for a protest that they may not relate to directly because they’re not Black, they’re not young, it shows how selfless people can be in the community and how much they’re willing to help people that they care about,” she said.Sheridan Zeck, 17, and Kai Johnson, 16, noted that many students live at an apartment complex adjacent to the police station and the high school. Sheridan said it breaks her heart that, because of police, people have not felt safe in their homes.“People have had to evacuate,” she said. “There’s families in there that are getting teargassed. They can’t sleep at night. They can’t breathe.”“This was a really great way to be able to channel all our emotions about what’s happening into a project and to be able to support protesters and be able to protest ourselves,” Kai said.Redmond said it\'s important to have protests where people can yell and shout in addition to healing gatherings, which often have a different energy. For her, the site of Wright’s death was the appropriate place for the Community Healing Team to go.“Somebody asked me, ‘Why don\'t you do the healing gathering at the police station?’ And I didn\'t think that that was appropriate,” Redmond said. “That was a place to protest, for people to yell, shout, and do whatever they needed to — which could also be healing. I don\'t want to act like it can\'t be. But I think it is a very different energy when you have police presence, when you have military presence.”After passing around the microphone to several members of the Community Healing Team at the Wright memorial site, Redmond encouraged attendees to share what was on their mind.One 26-year-old man started talking about his experiences with racial profiling and harassment in public spaces by his own neighbors. As he spoke, he became deeply upset.At one point, Redmond interrupted and embraced him. After a few moments, the man started to sob. Two other people joined the embrace.“You can hear it in his voice — he’s hurting,” said one member of the healing team after taking the microphone. “He loves this city. He loves this community.”The community healing team is letting people speak. One man got emotional talking about experiences racism and harassment at the pool, school. Organizer Leslie Redman embraced him. Others quickly joined. The man sobbed.\n\nOrganizers underscoring: Goal of this gathering is healingAt another point, a man took the microphone and led the crowd through a calming breathing exercise. As he concluded, the sun peeked through the overcast sky, and a soft glow shone over the crowd. The man smiled as he noticed.“Thank you, universe,” he said. “Thank yourselves.”Caroline Haskins is a technology reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.A BuzzFeed News investigation, in partnership with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, based on thousands of documents the government didn\'t want you to see.', '0');

He was funny and had big dreams for his future. He loved his family and his baby boy.“This time last year, almost a year ago, [the Floyd family] were facing the unimaginable. They were facing the agony of losing a family member to police excessive force,\" civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing both the Floyd and Wright families, said at a press conference Tuesday. \"And it is unbelievable — it is just something I could not fathom — that in Minneapolis, Minnesota, a suburb 10 miles from where the Chauvin trial regarding George Floyd was taking place, that a police officer would shoot and kill another unarmed Black man.\"\"My son was an amazing, loving kid,\" Katie said. \"He had a big heart.”On an old Facebook profile page, Wright often posted about gearing up for basketball games. In 2014, when he was just 13, he wrote confidently that he was “bout to try to drop 20 points\" at a game.After his death, a Facebook page supporting local youth sports shared an undated photo of Wright and his teammates, reminiscing about the time he spent playing basketball. \"Rest in peace to one of Heights very own,\" the post read. \"We shared many hours in the gym with you Daunte Wright.\"A sister of one of Wright\'s close friends, who asked not to be identified, told BuzzFeed News Wright was a big Chicago Bulls fan. Aside from basketball, he loved to play video games and hang out with his friends, she said, describing Wright as “the life of the party.”“He was just a really good friend,” she said. “We considered him to be our brother.”The woman said Wright was someone friends could always count on and that she felt she could open up to him about anything. She recalled one summer night a couple of years ago when he was at their house for a bonfire and went to sit with her because he could tell she had been crying. “I was kind of going through a breakup,” she said. “He came and put his arm around me and let me know that I deserve so much more and that I was going to get it. And I shouldn\'t settle for less.” She said Wright wanted to get a degree and “prove to himself that he could make it out of Brooklyn Park, Minneapolis.”“He was just trying to turn his life around,” she said.Daunte with his son, Daunte Jr.Aly Phay, 21, who met Wright through friends a few years ago, told BuzzFeed News Wright wanted to become \"rich and famous\" and was focused on making money and taking care of his son. She described him as a \"one-of-a-kind\" friend and someone who would always check up on her.Friends and family remembered Wright\'s smile as one that, as his mom put it, would \"light up the room it was so big and bright.\"“That’s what I remember most about him,\" Phay said. \"Even through hard times he always had a smile on his face! I still remember his laugh in my head.”Law enforcement officials have said officers pulled Wright over because of an expired registration tag on his car. When they ran his name through their system, they found he had a warrant out for his arrest because of a missed virtual court appearance for misdemeanor charges of carrying a handgun without a permit and running from police last June.A moment later, Katie said she heard the police officer return and ask Daunte to get out of the car. \"He said, ‘Am I in trouble?’ [The officer] said, ‘We’ll explain all that when you step out of the car,\'\" Katie recalled.They asked her son to put the phone down, and then she heard some scuffling before the officer asked Daunte and a female passenger who was in the car to hang up. When Katie called back, the female passenger answered the phone and told her the police had shot her son.Katie Wright cries during a press conference outside the Hennepin County Government Center in Minneapolis.Crump, the attorney, said Wright did not pose a threat to the police and was trying to flee because he was scared. \"Was it the best decision? No, but young people don’t always make the best decisions,” he said.During the press conference Tuesday, the Wright family was joined by relatives of Floyd and Emmett Till, the 14-year-old who was abducted, beaten, shot, and killed in 1955 while visiting relatives in Mississippi. Their presence demonstrated the pain Black people have endured for generations.\"Can you blame Daunte for being terrified, as a Black man in the custody of police? When you just watched, here in Minneapolis, George Floyd murdered at the hands of the very same police, and who was unarmed?\" said Brandon Williams, Floyd\'s nephew. \"At some point, we need change. At some point, we need better policing. At some point, we need officers to be held accountable, charged, and convicted.\"Stephanie Baer is a reporter with BuzzFeed News and is based in Los Angeles.

Wednesday’s hearing featured the government’s most comprehensive presentation to date that such a plan was at least partially put into action.Dozens of people are charged with assaulting police during the riots, but the Oath Keepers case is one of the few that include specific allegations that rioters had planned for violence and specifically made arrangements to have access to guns in DC, where firearms are generally restricted.Prosecutors filed a brief earlier this week alleging that Kenneth Harrelson of Florida was recorded on the morning of Jan. 7 at the Comfort Inn Ballston in Arlington, Virginia, rolling a luggage cart with what appeared to be a rifle case; the hotel is less than 8 miles from the Capitol. Harrelson is one of 12 people affiliated with the Oath Keepers who have been indicted on charges that they conspired to interfere with Congress’s certification of the election.Prosecutors say surveillance video from a Virginia hotel shows Kenneth Harrelson with what appears to be a rifle case.During Wednesday’s hearing — where the government successfully argued to keep Harrelson behind bars pending a trial — Assistant US Attorney Jeffrey Nestler said the evidence didn’t include images of guns, but that investigators had studied the footage from the Comfort Inn and believed it showed Harrelson and other members bringing out weapons the day after the insurrection.None of the defendants indicted in the Oath Keepers conspiracy have been charged with weapon-related crimes, and the government hasn’t presented evidence that any of them brought guns to the Capitol. Nestler told US District Judge Amit Mehta that the government believed other people affiliated with the armed extremist group, whom he did not name, were monitoring events on Jan. 6 from the Comfort Inn and communicating with members who were at the Capitol. These other individuals were “prepared to come into DC and ferry these weapons to the ground team that Mr. Harrelson was running.”“That is ... strong evidence of future dangerousness,” Mehta said.In an April 12 filing, the government highlighted messages that Harrelson had exchanged with other members of the alleged conspiracy before and after Jan. 6 via a group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal. On Jan. 5, Harrelson asked another member of the Oath Keepers, identified by the government as codefendant Kelly Meggs, about the address of the “QRF hotel.” Meggs replied, “Dm,” which prosecutors believe stood for “direct message,” suggesting he didn’t want to share messages about the hotel in a group chat.According to cell site location data, Harrelson arrived at the Comfort Inn roughly three hours after messaging Meggs on Jan. 5, stayed there for about an hour, and then drove into DC. On the morning of Jan. 7, the government said, Harrelson messaged the Signal group, “So we’re just leaving DC and I would like to know where my shits at since it seems everyone’s gone already.” Another person replied, “Did u leave it at Comfort Inn in that room?” Cell site data put Harrelson in the area of the hotel shortly after, according to the government, and that’s when surveillance video showed him with the purported rifle case.Harrelson’s attorneys have disputed that the surveillance video was proof of anything other than that he had luggage at the Comfort Inn. During Wednesday’s hearing, his attorney Nina Ginsberg tried to distance him from the actions and statements of other Oath Keepers defendants. She pointed out that he wasn’t part of what the government has described as a “stack” of Oath Keepers in tactical gear who advanced on the Capitol, but she acknowledged there was video of him nearby urging them on; she argued that others in the crowd were cheering on the stack.

In addition to the video of Harrelson outside the Capitol near the stack, prosecutors said videos from inside the building showed him moving between the Senate and House sides and noted that he was with Kelly Meggs, who messaged someone later about looking for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.The judge said the government’s “strongest” evidence against Harrelson was that he was “actively” trying to find lawmakers and obstruct Congress’s activities.Ken Bensinger and Jessica Garrison contributed reporting to this story.Zoe Tillman is a senior legal reporter with BuzzFeed News and is based in Washington, DC.A BuzzFeed News investigation, in partnership with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, based on thousands of documents the government didn\'t want you to see.', '0');

Elissa Slotkin wants the US to designate \"foreign terrorist organizations,\" four are defunct, one is American, and another is a part of an allied nation’s national guard.\n    Posted on April 14, 2021, at 2:31 p.m. ET\n    Rep. Elissa Slotkin questions witnesses during a hearing on Capitol Hill on Sept. 17, 2020, in Washington, DC.Rep. Elissa Slotkin last week sent a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken asking him to take the unprecedented step of designating 13 extremist movements as foreign terrorist organizations, arguing that such a move “will help apply more stress to curtail these violent organizations’ and their leaders’ ability to operate their groups.”But of the 13 groups listed in her letter, which her office provided to BuzzFeed News, at least four are defunct, one is an American club founded in California that has splintered and rebranded, and another changed the name used in Slotkin’s letter six years ago when it became part of an allied nation’s national guard.“It was a great list — in 2018,” Matthew Feldman, director of the London-based Centre for Analysis of the Radical Right, told BuzzFeed News. “Every one of [the listed groups] was active. Every one was dangerous.”Feldman praised Slotkin’s efforts and the motivation behind the list, saying they are a step in the right direction. But he also said it serves as an example of how the US government has been slow to recognize the threat posed by far-right violent extremists at home and abroad.Biden has signaled his intent to combat domestic violent extremists — specifically white supremacists like those who were among the mob that attacked the US Capitol on Jan. 6, and whom the FBI sees as a top threat. Department of Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkas told lawmakers last month that domestic violent extremism “poses the most lethal and persistent terrorism-related threat to the homeland today.”But experts say it is also important to go after foreign extremist groups, which often communicate, coordinate, and inspire their American counterparts.“It would also give the United States Government more tools to engage and flag the Americans who contact, support, train, and join these [white supremacist extremist] groups,” wrote Slotkin.But Elizabeth Neumann, the former assistant secretary of counterterrorism and threat prevention at the Department of Homeland Security during the Donald Trump administration, told BuzzFeed News that the process is lengthy and difficult.“The FTO process is a pretty high bar,” she said. “I was frustrated we were only able to get the Russian Imperial Movement. That was not the only group we looked at.”In April 2020, the US designated RIM and three of its leaders SDGTs — the first time such a classification had been used.A former CIA analyst who focused on foreign terrorist organizations in the Middle East, Slotkin wrote that she has been “struck by the threat these white supremacist groups pose, the amount of contact they have with extremists in the U.S., the minimal intelligence and diplomatic reporting we have on these groups, and the relative lack of review taken by the U.S. Government.”But not all of the groups she has asked the government to focus on are currently active.Kacper Rekawek, a Slovakia-based researcher at the nonprofit Counter Extremism Project, said Slotkin’s list is the type of list someone searching for far-right extremist groups on Google might draw up.“The effort of Rep. Slotkin is commendable. Designations, underused in the European context, should help with countering the threat of violence from extreme right-wing organizations,” Rekawek told BuzzFeed News. “However, this must be informed by a thorough analysis of the local far-right scenes which include a plethora of actors who often talk the talk, but do not walk the walk as far as violence is concerned.”After this story published, Slotkin\'s staff clarified they included RAM on the list as a way of identifying the group\'s foreign affiliates.Another problematic group on Slotkin’s list is Ukraine’s Azov Battalion. The paramilitary force was formed in 2014 by far-right extremists who volunteered to take up arms against Russia-backed forces when the war in eastern Ukraine broke out. In January 2016, it became part of the country’s National Guard and has since been known as the Azov Regiment.Its political wing, National Corps, has been labeled a “nationalist hate group” by the State Department. But designating the regiment as a foreign terrorist organization is likely to pose challenges, especially due to its attachment to the state and the fact that Ukraine is a US ally.BuzzFeed News reached out to Slotkin for comment on the list. An aide said they had been made aware of the status of Azov and the disbanded groups after the representative\'s letter was reported by Reuters. But, the aide said, they plan to move ahead with at least the groups on the list which remain active.Read Slotkin’s full letter.Christopher Miller is a reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New YorkA BuzzFeed News investigation, in partnership with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, based on thousands of documents the government didn\'t want you to see.', '0');

He s been under the assumption, like many of us, that the Christopher Steele-dossier was what prompted the Russia investigation so he s been lashing out at the Department of Justice and the FBI in order to protect Trump. As it happens, the dossier is not what started the investigation, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of Russian opposition research on Hillary Clinton.On top of that, Papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for Trump, as his administration has alleged. He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar.

It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear,  the report states.  But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians  role.

Instead, he fumed, visas had already been issued to immigrants at such a rate that his  friends were calling to say he looked like a fool  after making his broad pronouncements.It was then that Trump began reading from a document that a top advisor, noted white supremacist Stephen Miller, had handed him just before the meeting with his Cabinet. The page listed how many visas had been issued this year, and included 2,500 from Afghanistan (a country not on the travel ban), 15,000 from Haiti (also not included), and 40,000 from Nigeria (sensing a pattern yet?), and Trump expressed his dismay at each.According to witnesses in the room who spoke to the Times on condition of anonymity, and who were interviewed along with three dozen others for the article, Trump called out each country for its faults as he read: Afghanistan was a  terrorist haven,  the people of Nigeria would  never go back to their huts once they saw the glory of America, and immigrants from Haiti  all have AIDS. Despite the extensive research done by the newspaper, the White House of course denies that any such language was used.But given Trump s racist history and his advisor Stephen Miller s blatant white nationalism, it would be no surprise if a Freedom of Information Act request turned up that the document in question had the statements printed inline as commentary for the president to punctuate his anger with. It was Miller, after all, who was responsible for the  American Carnage  speech that Trump delivered at his inauguration.This racist is a menace to America, and he doesn t represent anything that this country stands for.

INSERT INTO `newsdisply` VALUES ('232', 'Trump Only Cares About Trump; Why He Is Recognizing Jerusalem Today', '\"President Donald Trump announced yesterday that he plans to formally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. While this is left most pundits perplexed, the reasoning is clear. Trump wants to divert attention from Robert Mueller s investigation. It is no coincidence that the day after the news broke that Deutsche Bank has received subpoenas for information on the Trump family s assets, that this Jerusalem decision was announced. What could be a bigger news story than getting this information? A blow up in the Middle East.Look at the reaction world leaders have had to this announcement. American allies throughout the Middle East and Europe have asked Trump not to do this and have stressed how dangerous a statement this is. US News and World Report put this out today: The mere consideration of Trump changing the status quo sparked a renewed U.S. security warning on Tuesday. America s consulate in Jerusalem ordered U.S. personnel and their families to avoid visiting Jerusalem s Old City or the West Bank, and urged American citizens in general to avoid places with increased police or military presence. It is worth noting that while Trump will formally announce that the U.S. will recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, there is no movement underway to relocate the embassy from Tel Aviv. In fact, he has signed an order to delay that decision for another six months. This move is necessary due to the 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act, which mandated the embassy be moved. It also allowed the president to delay that by six months and every president since that act became law has done so this way.The Atlantic has even compared this decision to Trump  wagging the dog,  a reference to a movie where a U.S. president goes to war with Albania to take the public s attention away from his own scandals involving a mistress. The film was viewed as a parody of President Bill Clinton s military actions in Afghanistan and Sudan after he acknowledged an affair with Monica Lewinsky.While whether or not Clinton attacked other countries to distract the nation from his actions with Lewinsky may be a point that is up for debate, it is clear that Trump likes to do things to distract the public s attention. Catherine Rampell wrote about this tactic late last year in the Washington Post. She wrote: Welcome to 2017, the ouroboros of distractions, where every terrible thing is a head-fake for a ruse for a diversion for a misdirection from something else much, much worse. Trump makes announcements, sends tweets and says things without any thought to the real world consequences that follow. Experts in the Middle East fear that the Jerusalem announcement will lead to real deaths. Many people worry  that his thoughtless and impetuous tweets will lead to a nuclear war. His thoughtless comments confuse and enrage many.By making such a move, for such purely personal reasons, Trump is proving, once again, that he is not fit to be president of a condo association, much less of the United States.Featured image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images.\"', '0', '1');

He s been under the assumption, like many of us, that the Christopher Steele-dossier was what prompted the Russia investigation so he s been lashing out at the Department of Justice and the FBI in order to protect Trump. As it happens, the dossier is not what started the investigation, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of Russian opposition research on Hillary Clinton.On top of that, Papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for Trump, as his administration has alleged. He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar. Coffee boys  don t help to arrange a New York meeting between Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt two months before the election. It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear,  the report states.  But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians  role. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and is now a cooperating witness with Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team.This isn t a presidency.

Instead, he fumed, visas had already been issued to immigrants at such a rate that his  friends were calling to say he looked like a fool  after making his broad pronouncements.It was then that Trump began reading from a document that a top advisor, noted white supremacist Stephen Miller, had handed him just before the meeting with his Cabinet. The page listed how many visas had been issued this year, and included 2,500 from Afghanistan (a country not on the travel ban), 15,000 from Haiti (also not included), and 40,000 from Nigeria (sensing a pattern yet?), and Trump expressed his dismay at each.According to witnesses in the room who spoke to the Times on condition of anonymity, and who were interviewed along with three dozen others for the article, Trump called out each country for its faults as he read: Afghanistan was a  terrorist haven,  the people of Nigeria would  never go back to their huts once they saw the glory of America, and immigrants from Haiti  all have AIDS. Despite the extensive research done by the newspaper, the White House of course denies that any such language was used.But given Trump s racist history and his advisor Stephen Miller s blatant white nationalism, it would be no surprise if a Freedom of Information Act request turned up that the document in question had the statements printed inline as commentary for the president to punctuate his anger with. It was Miller, after all, who was responsible for the  American Carnage  speech that Trump delivered at his inauguration.This racist is a menace to America, and he doesn t represent anything that this country stands for.

INSERT INTO `newsdisply` VALUES ('519', 'Trump Only Cares About Trump; Why He Is Recognizing Jerusalem Today', '\"President Donald Trump announced yesterday that he plans to formally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. While this is left most pundits perplexed, the reasoning is clear. Trump wants to divert attention from Robert Mueller s investigation. It is no coincidence that the day after the news broke that Deutsche Bank has received subpoenas for information on the Trump family s assets, that this Jerusalem decision was announced. What could be a bigger news story than getting this information? A blow up in the Middle East.Look at the reaction world leaders have had to this announcement. American allies throughout the Middle East and Europe have asked Trump not to do this and have stressed how dangerous a statement this is. US News and World Report put this out today: The mere consideration of Trump changing the status quo sparked a renewed U.S. security warning on Tuesday. America s consulate in Jerusalem ordered U.S. personnel and their families to avoid visiting Jerusalem s Old City or the West Bank, and urged American citizens in general to avoid places with increased police or military presence. It is worth noting that while Trump will formally announce that the U.S. will recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, there is no movement underway to relocate the embassy from Tel Aviv. In fact, he has signed an order to delay that decision for another six months. This move is necessary due to the 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act, which mandated the embassy be moved. It also allowed the president to delay that by six months and every president since that act became law has done so this way.The Atlantic has even compared this decision to Trump  wagging the dog,  a reference to a movie where a U.S. president goes to war with Albania to take the public s attention away from his own scandals involving a mistress. The film was viewed as a parody of President Bill Clinton s military actions in Afghanistan and Sudan after he acknowledged an affair with Monica Lewinsky.While whether or not Clinton attacked other countries to distract the nation from his actions with Lewinsky may be a point that is up for debate, it is clear that Trump likes to do things to distract the public s attention. Catherine Rampell wrote about this tactic late last year in the Washington Post. She wrote: Welcome to 2017, the ouroboros of distractions, where every terrible thing is a head-fake for a ruse for a diversion for a misdirection from something else much, much worse. Trump makes announcements, sends tweets and says things without any thought to the real world consequences that follow. Experts in the Middle East fear that the Jerusalem announcement will lead to real deaths. Many people worry  that his thoughtless and impetuous tweets will lead to a nuclear war. His thoughtless comments confuse and enrage many.By making such a move, for such purely personal reasons, Trump is proving, once again, that he is not fit to be president of a condo association, much less of the United States.Featured image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images.\"', '0', '1621040619405');

The Texas Republican denied allegations of sexual harassment but admitted allowing an unprofessional culture in his Capitol Hill office. On Thursday the ethics committee voted unanimously to investigate whether Farenthold used his congressional staff and other resources of the House of Representatives to further his political campaign, and if he had made false statements or omissions to the committee. The panel was already looking into whether he committed sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation against a former staff member and if he made inappropriate statements to other members of his staff.
